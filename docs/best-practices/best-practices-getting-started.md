# Introduction

In a world of security breaches and identity theft, providing services to users is complicated. How can you create the best user experience and make signing in easier while protecting user data and assets?

ZenKey offers a solution. As a joint venture between the three major US carriers, ZenKey leverages encryption technologies in mobile phones and mobile networks. The platform packages multiple factors of authentication into a streamlined experience for app and website providers taking advantage of the unique capabilities and insights of wireless carriers. It then applies those capabilities to provide an easy and secure way to register, login, and perform other types of authorizations within apps and services. The result is a better user experience and a more secure link to your users.
