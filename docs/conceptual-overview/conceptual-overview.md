# Overview

ZenKey is a joint venture with Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobil that leverages encryption technologies in mobile phones and carrier networks. The platform packages multiple factors of authentication in a convenient user experience for apps and websites.  Service Providers employ unique capabilities and information available to wireless carriers and apply them for secure registration, log-in, and other authorizations for apps and services. The results are better for users and more secure for Service Providers.

ZenKey uses the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication protocol to obtain user identities and notifications from participating wireless carriers. The information contains actionable information to prevent unathorized access or fraud.

## ZenKey use cases
ZenKey is more secure and more convenient because the Service Provider relys on user device hardware and mobile-network infrastructure. Together the user's mobile phone SIM card and the mobile network secure all transactions.
