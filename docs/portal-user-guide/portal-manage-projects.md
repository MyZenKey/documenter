# Manage projects

After setting up the first project and client, logging into the ZenKey portal displays the projects overview page.

On the projects overview page, you can: 
  *  View your existing projects.
  *  View the configuration settings and clients for a project.
  *  Create a new client and add it to a project.
  *  View the carrier provisioning status of each client.
  *  View more details about a client, including Redirect URIs and carrier provisioning status. Client provisioning status is ‘Submitted’ until all carriers provision the client. Afterward, the status becomes ‘Active’, setting the project status to ’Active’.
