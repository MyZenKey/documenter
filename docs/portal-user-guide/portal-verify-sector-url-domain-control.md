# Verify Sector URL Domain Control

To verify sector URI domain control, follow the portal instructions:

  *  Download a JSON file.
  *  Place the file in a specific location in your domain. When ZenKey finds the file, your client moves to carrier provisioning.
  *  Proceed with the client setup steps. You can post the JSON file at your convenience.
