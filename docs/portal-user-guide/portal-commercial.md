# Commercial agreement

After your company has been approved by ZenKey, you must accept either the Limited Trial Agreement or the Commercial Agreement. These are standard terms â€“ make sure to note the restrictions. You must acknowledge that you have the authority to agree to the Limited Trial Agreement or the Commercial Agreement on behalf of your company.

After accepting an Agreement, you can start setting up a Project.

## The Limited Trial Agreement
The Limited Trial Agreement gives you and your company the ability to integrate and test ZenKey before you agree to the Commercial Agreement. The Limited Trial Agreement will not allow you to launch your integrated services publicly.

After accepting the Limited Trial Agreement, you will have access to Developer Mode but will not be able to launch your app.
- Clients you create for an app or website will be created in Developer Mode. For more information about Developer Mode, see [Working with Developer Mode](doc:portal-working-with-developer-mode).
- Your integrated app or website is not visible in the in-app ZenKey Directory where end users discover launched ZenKey-integrated apps.
- If the ZenKey app is not in Developer Mode, it will be unable to recognize or function with your integrated app or website client that is in Developer Mode.
- If an end user uses ZenKey to try to authenticate with your Developer Mode client, the user will receive an error message and the authentication will fail. To avoid this, do not expose your app to end users prior to accepting the Commercial Agreement and launching your app.

## The Commercial Agreement
You can upgrade from a Limited Trial Agreement to a Commercial Agreement when you are ready to launch your app, or you can sign up for a Commercial Agreement directly.

After accepting the Commercial Agreement, you can launch a client from Developer Mode to Launched Mode. For more information about Launched Mode, see [Working with Launched Mode](doc:working-with-launched-mode).

When your integrated app or website is in Launched Mode, the following conditions apply:
  * The ZeyKey in-app directory lists your launched app or website.
  * Your agreed pricing and billing terms immediately go into effect.
  * Your end users (the general public) can authenticate your launched app or website using their ZenKey apps.
