# Configure project links

Provide the following information:  

**Domain URI** (must start with http:// or https://)
  * This is the URI associated with your app or service integrated with ZenKey. End-users discovering your service while browsing the ZenKey directory can use your logo to navigate to this page, which serves as a sign-in page to initiate their ZenKey set-up with your app or website. This link also provides additional information about your app or service.
 

**Sector URI**   
  * Sector URIs enable multiple clients to keep consistent sub-identifiers for identifying a single end-user across clients. Sector URIs are set at the project level and apply to each client in the project.
  * Use sector URIs across projects to identify a single end-user across multiple apps.

**Privacy Policy Link**
  * Providing a link to your privacy policy is required. ZenKey displays this link to end-users before they consent to use ZenKey with your app or service.
  * The privacy policy must cover all clients in a project.

**Terms of Service Link**
  * Providing a link to your terms of service is required. ZenKey displays this link for end-users so that they may read your terms before consenting to use ZenKey with your app or service.
  * The terms of service must cover all clients in a project.

**Notification URI**
  * This provides notifications of completed server-initiated authentication transactions. 
     For more information about the server-initiated authentication flow, see [Enabling on a primary device](doc:enabling-zenkey-on-a-primary-device).

The Project Links in this section are automatically applied to all clients within the Project."
