# Launched mode

Organizations governed by ZenKey's Commercial Agreement can put their clients into **Launched Mode**.

## What is Launched Mode?

Launching a client for an integrated app or website removes it from Developer Mode and makes it visible in the ZenKey in-app directory.
End-users can use ZenKey to authenticate with integrated apps or websites that have been launched. 

### Requirements for launching a client

  * Accepted the commercial agreement.
  * All carriers provisioned the clients.
  * Verified billing contact. 
  * Configured billing account.

**Note**: We strongly recommend putting clients through verification testing before launching.

## Steps for launching a client or integrated app

Agreed-upon pricing and billing terms go into effect after launch.
Billing charges for the client appear in the next invoice. For more information, see [View Billing Invoices](doc:view-billing-invoices).
1. Accept the Commercial Agreement. 
2. Select a project.
3. Find and select the client in the client area. When the client fulfills all requirements, it enables the **Launch Client** button.
4. Click **Launch Client**.

##Steps for revoking a client

Revoking a client puts the client back into developer mode and pauses all billing charges. 
1. Log into the Developer Portal
2. Select a project.
3. Find and select the client in the client area.
4. Click **Revoke Client**, which is enabled when the client is in Launched Mode.
